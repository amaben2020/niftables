- Sections are Organisms equivalent on [atomic design pattern](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). They are groups of modules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.
- These sections will be using to create templates
- Components that are used only once should be nested in its parents folder
- Components used more than once should be extracted into the `/elements` folder

- `/two-columns`
- `/two-columns/cta-button`
- `/two-columns/inputs/text`
- `/two-columns/inputs/select`
- `/two-columns/inputs/checkbox`
- `/product-list`
- `/product-list/product`
